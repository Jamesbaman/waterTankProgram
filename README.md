# Water Tank Program
This program is used as an exercise for abstraction with classes and methods. <br>
It has an abstract class(WaterTank) and two subclasses(HomeTank) and (BuildingTank) with different limits for its values. <br>
This uses JOptionPane in its UI and applies basic CRUD operations, which are: <br>
Create - Choose between the two tanks <br>

Update - Add or subtract the amount of water in the tank <br>
Delete - The program ends when the tank is either empty or full
