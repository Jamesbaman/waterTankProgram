# Water Tank Program
This program is used as an exercise for abstraction with classes and methods.
It has an abstract class(WaterTank) and two subclasses(HomeTank) and (BuildingTank) with different limits for its values.
This uses JOptionPane in its UI and applies basic CRUD operations, which are:
Create - Choose between the two tanks
Read - Displays how much water is in the tank you have chosen
Update - Add or subtract the amount of water in the tank
Delete - The program ends when the tank is either empty or full
